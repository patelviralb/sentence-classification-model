# Sentence Classification for Personal Assistant

For the project, I have implemented classification algorithm to learn how the personal digital assistants can infer actions from user input to perform the specific action. As an initial approach, I have considered to implement classification of 2 different actions based on user inputs. Also, for simplicity, I have decided to take input as text statements which mimics the user inputs given as voice.

E.g.:
**Input:** “Play the song”
**Output:** Classified as “PlayMusic” class
